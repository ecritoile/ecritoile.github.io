## Reflections on Digital Literacy as a College Student

As a student majoring in Interactive Media and minoring in Literature at a liberal arts university, digital literacy is more than just a buzzword—it's an everyday reality, a set of tools, practices, and mindsets I navigate both consciously and unconsciously. Whether I’m building interactive websites, annotating texts, editing videos, or conducting digital research, digital literacy is embedded in the very way I think, learn, and communicate. And yet, it is also something I am constantly redefining, especially as I work alongside students from varied disciplines whom each bring their own fluency in different digital dialects. My sense of digital literacy is constantly evolving, impacted by not only my own definitions and experiences, but also by that of my peers.

## Digital Software and Literacy in Daily Life

In my academic life, digital literacy takes on multiple forms. For working on projects and assignments, I’ve often relied on software on the Adobe Creative Suite (such as Photoshop and Illustrator) and web development platforms like VS Code, Figma, and WordPress. These tools not only let me design and share ideas visually, but also push me to consider how information is experienced through design, accessibility, and interactivity. I’ve also experimented with Unity for interactive storytelling and augmented reality installations. Such tools expand the canvas for narrative expression, but they also challenge me to visualize and realize my ideas within the limitations they inherently have. I’ve also used software such as Zotero to organize academic sources.

In courses that require data manipulation and analysis, particularly ones that intersect with media studies or digital culture, I’ve learned to use Python and R (with tools like Matplotlib) to parse social media data, visualize network connections, and analyze patterns of interaction online. The transition from qualitative to quantitative analysis wasn’t intuitive at first, but it helped me develop a more multi-dimensional view of culture and technology.

One such project that I recently worked on was a distant reading of the subtitles of Severance, a TV show I greatly enjoyed. I used Voyant Tools and R to analyze and compare the frequency of certain words by episode and see if I could draw any conclusions about the show from the findings. It was an experience through which I not only learned and practiced to use such tools but also expanded my understanding of this growing intersection of different mediums and tools.

I also use platforms such as Notion to structure my collaborative projects, keep track of group assignments, and write about my progress (especially about my Capstone project). Social media platforms like Instagram, Discord, and Linkedin have also been integral in allowing me to keep in contact with people and opportunities.

Digital software, and thus digital literacy, have grown in prominence in every regard. They are used in most imaginable spheres of college life, from professional to academic to social—and perhaps more importantly, they have contributed to the merging of said spheres.

## Interdisciplinary Collaboration and Digital Humanities

Being in a liberal arts environment has exposed me to classmates who bring radically different digital literacies to the table. A Computer Science major might write an efficient machine learning model in minutes, while an Art History student might use digital archives to reconstruct historical narratives visually. In these interdisciplinary settings, collaboration becomes a learning strategy — not just for achieving a project’s goal, but for expanding my own digital perspective.

Digital humanities, as I’ve come to understand through coursework and hands-on projects, is not simply about digitizing texts or visualizing data. It's about reimagining what it means to do humanities in the digital age. According to Johanna Drucker’s [*Digital Humanities Coursebook*](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/mono/10.4324/9781003106531-1/digital-humanities-overview-johanna-drucker?context=ubx&refId=d32fa15e-299e-4b0e-a0b7-496606198488), every project sits at the intersection of three main components: materials, processing, and presentation. It is a general structure that forces us to be conscious of both our sources, the tools we use to interpret them, and the methods through which we present said information.

In a class session from earlier on in the semester, I was struck by how even something as seemingly mundane as choosing a data format or visualization layout carries implicit arguments about meaning and hierarchy. For example, the remediation of analog materials into digital files (through scanning, tagging, or transcription) is not a neutral process; it shapes what becomes visible, searchable, and ultimately knowable. This critical awareness extends into processing, where tools like text analysis or network diagrams may automate comparison but also embed biases based on what is modeled or excluded.

In my own projects, I’ve started to think more about how digital methods can enhance but not replace the interpretative nuance of humanistic inquiry. For instance, working with Voyant Tools and R for the aforementioned distant reading project has helped me appreciate how interface design and platform choice influence the way scholarship is presented and received. Digital humanities, then, offers not only technical tools but also a critical framework for navigating the ethical, aesthetic, and epistemological choices we make when we bring human culture into computational space.

## Critical Reflections and Growth

Even with my background in Interactive Media, I find myself humbled by how fast the digital world evolves. To be frank, I still struggle with the plethora of subjects that the digital encompasses and contains frontend and backend systems, data structures, and programming paradigms…the list is much too long). Learning about APIs, databases, and even just how data flows across platforms is something I’m trying to better grasp—not necessarily to become an expert in all areas, but to understand the general architecture that supports digital experiences.

Another area I’m learning more about is ethical engagement with AI and machine learning. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into content creation, I’ve been reflecting more on what it means to author, to create, and to take responsibility. Courses on media ethics and algorithmic accountability have helped me think critically about data bias, surveillance, and the hidden labor behind digital tools. I want to keep learning how to approach AI not just as a tool, but as a socio-technical system with implications for equity, authorship, and power.

In that vein, I was particularly intrigued and somewhat struck by Nitin Rane and Saurabh Choudhary’s writing in their paper [*Role and challenges of ChatGPT, Google Bard, and similar generative Artificial Intelligence in Arts and Humanities*](https://www.sabapub.com/index.php/she/article/view/999). Though they acknowledge and discuss the numerous challenges (both technical and ethical) of working with AI, they ultimately believe that the collaboration and relationship between humans and AI can “enrich our understanding of human creativity, diverse cultures, and historical knowledge.”

This notion of positivity is one that I have been particularly challenged by. Though I have always been skeptical and critical of AI (I had barely used ChatGPT or other LLMs before taking this class) and have regarded it as an ultimate blight on human creativity, I recognize that its growth and expansion is not something that will stop anytime soon. As the presence of AI takes root and spreads throughout the very foundations of society, I reckon it is time that I start to contemplate how best I can use it—and ethically so.

## Looking Ahead: New Ways of Thinking

As I move forward, I want to deepen my understanding of three key areas:

1. Critical Data Literacy: Learning to read data not just for what it shows, but for what it hides. Interrogating how data is collected, whose voices are missing, and how analysis can be misused.

2. Narrative Computation: Exploring how computational structures can be used to tell stories, from branching narratives and generative plots to interactive fiction and data-driven poetry.

3. Techno-Humanist Collaboration: Seeking spaces where artists, coders, writers, and theorists can co-create, co-question, and co-innovate—not in silos, but in shared languages of inquiry and imagination.

In many ways, being digitally literate today means being open to continuous learning. It’s not just about mastering tools, but about cultivating the ability to adapt, to think critically, and to ask the right questions about the systems we engage with. In the modern era, digital literacy is not just a skill set. It’s a mindset, a practice, and, for those of us in liberal arts, a bridge between creativity and computation, storytelling and systems thinking.

And so, I move forward with three c’s in mind—curiosity, collaboration, and caution—ready to keep discovering how the digital shapes humanity and how humanity shapes the digital.
